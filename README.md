# 🎓 FLIP – Mobile App Development Final Project  

## Overview  
This project is the **mobile implementation of the FLIP app**, originally designed in Figma by **Alexis Penuell** (with collaborators Peyton Giannone and Polina Iaremchuk).  

FLIP is an interactive educational platform that uses **game-based learning** to support meaningful group learning among college students. The app seeks to combat the **loneliness epidemic** by fostering collaboration, in-person connections, and shared academic success.  

This repository contains my final project for **Mobile App Development**, where I translated the UX/UI prototype into a functioning mobile application.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Convert the **Figma UX/UI prototype** into a fully functioning mobile app.  
- Preserve the design intent: focus on **community, interactivity, and gamification**.  
- Implement core features such as:  
  - ✅ User registration & profiles  
  - ✅ Study group creation and scheduling  
  - ✅ Gamified learning sessions (leaderboards, points, study games)  
  - ✅ Calendar sync for assignments/tests  
  - ✅ Collaborative multiplayer projected game support (where feasible)

## 👩‍💻 Our Role  
For this project, We worked on:  
- Implementing UI screens based on the **provided Figma designs**  
- Connecting navigation flows between screens  
- Adding backend stubs for features like user groups, progress tracking, and leaderboards  
- Testing layouts and responsiveness across mobile devices
